# Dunia: Text RPG
A little text game written in Python, inspired by early 2000s MMOs. Sneakily wrote it in my senior class across a few weeks because I despise having to learn Pascal.

Featuring:
+ Turn-based combat and a school-flavored spell casting system
+ All tiers of equipment for every equipment slot
+ Functional quests and conversations with NPCs
+ All sorts of zones with different random encounters
